## Question 1: Thread vs Process

**Question**: Explain the difference between a **thread** and a **process**. Why did we use threads in this assignment instead of creating separate processes?

**Your Answer:**
A process is an independent program with its own memory, while a thread is a smaller unit that runs inside a process and shares resources. Threads are usually faster and easier to create than processes. In this assignment, we used threads because all tasks share the same queue and data in one program. This made the simulation easier to manage. Using processes would make it more complicated without much benefit.

## Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior

**Question**: In Round-Robin scheduling, what happens when a process doesn't finish within its time quantum? Explain using an example from your program output.

**Your Answer:**
In Round-Robin scheduling, if a process does not finish during its time quantum, it goes back to the ready queue. It waits there until it gets another chance to run. In my program, after a process runs one quantum, if it still has remaining time, it is added back to the queue again. This keeps repeating until the process finishes. This way, all processes get a fair chance to use the CPU.



Example from my output:
```
P1 completed quantum 4000ms  
Remaining time: 5938ms  
P1 yields CPU for context switch  
P1 (Priority: 5) added to ready queue  


**Explanation of example:**
This example shows that P1 did not finish in one quantum, so it returned to the ready queue. It will run again later when it gets another turn.

## Question 3: Thread States

**Question**: A thread can be in different states: **New**, **Runnable**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**. Walk through these states for one process (P1) from your simulation.

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. For each state, explain when P1 enters that state during the simulation. Use your understanding of the code to trace through the lifecycle.]

1. **New**: [When is P1 in New state?]

2. **Runnable**: [When does P1 become Runnable?]

3. **Running**: [When is P1 Running?]

4. **Waiting**: [When/why would P1 be Waiting?]

5. **Terminated**: [When is P1 Terminated?]

**Your Answer:**

### Example 1: [Name of application/scenario]

**Description**: 
[Describe the real-world scenario or application]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
